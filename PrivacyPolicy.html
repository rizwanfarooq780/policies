<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: 15 August 2025</p>

<p>Thank you for using DueMate: Bills &amp; Budget ("DueMate"). Your privacy is very important to us. This Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it and the choices you have. This document applies to all versions of DueMate on Android.</p>

<h2>What We Collect</h2>
<p>DueMate does not require you to create an account or provide any personal information to use the core features. All of your bills, budgets, expenses and subscriptions are stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device. We do not connect to your bank or financial accounts.</p>

<h2>Crash Reports</h2>
<p>We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymous crash reports. Crashlytics captures limited device information (such as Android version and device model) to help us fix bugs. No personally identifiable information is stored or transmitted.</p>

<h2>Usage Data</h2>
<p>DueMate does not collect analytics or usage data by default. You may opt into anonymous usage analytics in a future update.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Your data is encrypted using industry‑standard AES‑GCM encryption. When you set up a PIN or biometric lock, your data is further protected. When you export a backup, you choose a password to encrypt the file. We never see or store your password.</p>

<h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
<p>DueMate may link to third‑party services such as Google Play for subscriptions. Those services are governed by their own privacy policies. We do not share your data with any third parties.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of DueMate after we publish changes means you agree to the new policy.</p>

<h2>Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@duemate.app">support@duemate.app</a>.</p>
